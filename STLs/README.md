# Printing Instructions

**Important: Don't change the parts orientation.**    
Each STL part has already been placed with the best possible orientation to reduce need for support and to improve print quality.

## Handles
- Support: Yes (slicer default works fine)
- Bridging: Yes (reduces need for support)
- Infil: 15%-20%
- Top solid layers: 4+


## Trigger
- Support: No
- Bridging: No
- Infil: 15%

## Magwell
- Support: Yes (custom)
